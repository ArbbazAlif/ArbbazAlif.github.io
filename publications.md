# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on. Each project's description and README are included below.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning Project
<!-- The project presents a Deep Q-learning-based agent to optimize HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems. The environment is modeled using fundamental heat transfer equations, enabling the agent to outperform traditional thermostat-based controls. -->
